#### Gate 4: Polish Gate ‚Äî "VP-Ready"
**Progress: 0% Complete**

‚ùå **Pending:**
- VP deck creation
- Signed archive preparation

### Key Findings This Week

#### Positive Discoveries
1. **Solid Foundation**: Existing VisionOS app has comprehensive 3D visualization already implemented
2. **Good Architecture**: MVVM pattern with proper separation of concerns
3. **Working API Integration**: MempoolService successfully connects to mempool.space
4. **Rich Documentation**: Existing README and SETUP docs are comprehensive

#### Technical Challenges Identified
1. **Performance Concerns**: Current transaction cube generation may not scale well
2. **Missing Real-time Data**: No WebSocket implementation for live updates
3. **Limited Error Handling**: Need more robust error states and recovery
4. **No Self-hosting Support**: Missing Docker configuration for private nodes

#### Architectural Decisions Made
1. **Keep Existing Foundation**: Build upon current VisionOS implementation rather than restart
2. **Enhance vs. Replace**: Improve existing 3D visualization rather than rebuild
3. **Docker Backend**: Use containerized approach for self-hosting support
4. **AGPL-3.0 Compliance**: Maintain open source license with proper attribution

### Next Week Priorities (August 26-30)

#### High Priority (Gate 1 Completion)
1. **Backend Docker Setup**: Create compose.yml for self-hosted mempool backend
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement GitHub Actions for VisionOS builds
3. **License Compliance**: Add AGPL-3.0 attribution and compliance documentation
4. **WebSocket Integration**: Add real-time data streaming capability

#### Medium Priority (Gate 2 Preparation)
1. **Performance Optimization**: Improve transaction visualization scalability
2. **Fee Strata Implementation**: Enhance 3D visualization with fee layers
3. **Design System**: Create DESIGN_TOKENS.md documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Improve robustness and user experience

### Risks and Mitigation

#### Current Risks
1. **CI Setup Complexity**: VisionOS builds may require specific Xcode configuration
   - *Mitigation*: Research GitHub Actions VisionOS examples, consider Xcode Cloud
2. **Performance Scaling**: Large transaction counts could impact frame rate
   - *Mitigation*: Implement entity pooling and level-of-detail system
3. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates may require significant architecture changes
   - *Mitigation*: Design as enhancement to existing REST API, not replacement

#### Upcoming Risks
1. **Quality Gate Dependencies**: Each gate depends on previous completion
2. **VisionOS Testing**: Limited testing capabilities without physical hardware
3. **Design Complexity**: VP-ready presentation requires high design quality

### Resource Requirements

#### Development Tools Needed
- Xcode 16+ with VisionOS SDK
- Vision Pro Simulator for testing
- Docker for backend development
- Design tools for VP presentation

#### External Dependencies
- mempool.space API availability
- GitHub Actions VisionOS support
- Apple Developer account for signing

### Success Metrics

#### This Week
- ‚úÖ Documentation framework: 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Architecture decisions: 100% complete
- üîÑ Gate 1 progress: 40% complete (target was 60%)

#### Next Week Targets
- Gate 1 completion: 100%
- Gate 2 initiation: 20%
- CI pipeline: Functional
- Backend Docker: Deployable

### Team Notes

#### What's Working Well
- Clear quality gate structure provides good milestone tracking
- Existing VisionOS foundation saves significant development time
- Comprehensive documentation approach ensures nothing is missed

#### Areas for Improvement
- Need faster progress on infrastructure setup (CI/CD, Docker)
- Should parallelize some Gate 1 tasks to accelerate completion
- Consider early Gate 2 preparation while finishing Gate 1

#### Lessons Learned
- Thorough analysis upfront pays dividends in implementation speed
- Existing code quality is higher than initially expected
- Documentation-first approach helps identify gaps early
